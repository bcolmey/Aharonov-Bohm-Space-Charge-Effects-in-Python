# Aharonov-Bohm-Space-Charge-Effects-in-Python
A python script simulating an electron wavepacket undergoing various quantum mechanical effects, such as double slit diffraction and the Aharanov-Bohm effect with space charge. 

This program is a numerical solution to one of physics' most popular experiment: the diffraction of a single electron through two slits. More precisely it is a python script that displays an animation of the propagation of a gaussian wave packet and its interaction with an arbitrary number of slits. The program solves the two-dimensional time-dependant Schr√∂dinger equation using Crank-Nicolson algorithm and perfectly reflecting boundary conditions.

## Running

To run this code simply clone this repository and run the animate_wave_function.py script with python (the numpy and matplotlib modules are required):
 
```
$ git clone https://github.com/FelixDesrochers/Electron-diffraction/
$ cd Electron-diffraction
$ python animate_wave_function.py 
```

The parameters of the simulation (shape and size of the potential, shape and speed of the wave packet, etc.) can be modified at the beginning of the animate_wave_function.py script. 

## Examples

Here are some examples of animations produced by the program.
