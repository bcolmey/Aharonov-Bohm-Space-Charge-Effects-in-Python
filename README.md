# Aharonov-Bohm-Space-Charge-Effects-in-Python
A python script simulating an electron wavepacket undergoing various quantum mechanical effects, such as double slit diffraction and the Aharanov-Bohm effect with space charge. The program solves the two-dimensional time-dependant Schr√∂dinger equation using Crank-Nicolson algorithm adapted from the work of Felix Desrochers and perfectly matched layers conditions. A full description of the code can be found here:

## Running

To run this code simply clone this repository and run the animate_wave_function.py script with python (the numpy and matplotlib modules are required):
 
```
$ git clone https://github.com/bcolmey/Aharonov-Bohm-Space-Charge-Effects-in-Python
$ cd Aharonov-Bohm-Space-Charge-Effects-in-Python
$ python run_me.py 
```

## Examples:
